# OpenOS
# An OS from scratch
# Important!
If you check the commit history, You'll see that one of the members of the OpenOS team decided to make a site with Google Sites.  
DO NOT VIEW IT, As it will track you! (I don't support using site tools that inject tracking scripts. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CODE IN YOUR OWN SITE!)  
I'm going to make a good NON-TRACKING OpenOS site with markdown soon.  
# Todo list
- [x] Upload kernel code
- [ ] Make bootable ISO
- [ ] Add File System support
