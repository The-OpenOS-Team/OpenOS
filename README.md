## OpenOS Repository
The [main developer of this project](https://github.com/sc39IsADev) has stopped maintaining OpenOS. There are other members of the project who update this codebase sometimes, but this project is otherwise unmaintained, and it's usage is not recommended. 

While one of the other developers keeps adding the link to an OpenOS fork, you really shouldn't use it unless you know what you are doing.  
I actually made my own (private) fork once which got updated more often, but I think that code was on a (now broken) HDD.  

The other developer is adding some code, but it's still reccomended not to use it like [the main developer of this project](https://github.com/sc39IsADev) said so.

I see you sneaking through Releases ;)
