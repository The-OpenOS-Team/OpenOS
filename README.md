# OpenOS
# An OS from scratch
# NOTE
Due to intense README Vandalism here and hate towards me (sc39) from `thesudodev`, I have removed `thesudodev` from the OpenOS team.  
At the same time, I'm planning to port as much code as I can to Rust.
# Todo list
- [x] Upload original C kernel code
- [ ] Port some code to Rust.
- [ ] Make bootable ISO
- [ ] Add File System support (I'll use FAT if I can)
- [ ] Add app system (ELF?)
