# OpenOS
# An OS from scratch
# Important!
If you check the commit history, One of the members of the OpenOS team decided to make a site with Google Sites.  
DO NOT VIEW IT, As it will track you! (I don't support using site tools that inject tracking scripts. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR OWN SITE'S CODE!)  
I'm going to make a good NON-TRACKING OpenOS site with markdown soon.  
# Todo list
- [x] Upload kernel code
- [ ] Make bootable ISO
- [ ] Add File System support
- [ ] Add app subsystem
