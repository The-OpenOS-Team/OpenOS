# OpenOS
# An OS from scratch
# Important!
thesudodev keeps on ruining this readme. I'll rollback to my changes in this section once more, but I'll remake the repo if it gets ruined again so nobody has to deal with the annoying chain of the page being ruined and rolled back.
# Todo list
- [x] Upload kernel code
- [ ] Make bootable ISO
- [ ] Add File System support
- [ ] Add app subsystem
