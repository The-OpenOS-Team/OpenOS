## OpenOS Repository
I've tried everything, but it hasn't worked.

So let me just make this as clear as possible:

This repository is **NOT** maintained!

[The other OpenOS developer](https://github.com/thesudodev) claims to have a updated fork [here](https://github.com/thesudodev/OpenOS-Recoded), but visiting it will just give you the 404 page. (maybe it's a private repository?)

I tried contacting them about it because I wanted to see what they've added to OpenOS and also verify that it's not just malware or something like that, but they still haven't responded while also being active enough to see the messages.

I hate [The other OpenOS developer](https://github.com/thesudodev) continuing to change this README file to basically say "no, use my nonexistent fork it's better".

I don't have time to make this anymore.

I have other code I'm writing.
Other things I'm doing.
Other places I'm going.
Other people I'm meeting.

I thought this project was dead ***years ago***, and it is! (last actual code-related commit [here](https://github.com/The-OpenOS-Team/OpenOS/commit/eef1e87f5cc8023367ec09780561c899d2586063), which is from late 2020)

All of the commits after that are just README changes.

I really want this to end.
I shouldn't need to do this.
I shouldn't need to edit this.
