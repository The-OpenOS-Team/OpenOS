# News on 0.03
Well, 0.02 was in 2020, made by sc39, and I don't want to piss him off any longer, so I am making this a seperate .md, and I am thinking on adding some new features to 0.03.

Like...

- FAT32 Support
- ReactOS Code intergration
- EFI Support
- NT 6.0 APIs (Windows XP kEX, with ROS)

I am planning this in June/July this year, so to the remaining fanbase, keep your fingers crossed.
